# Spelling-recommender-function

In this project, we first investigate and pre-process some texts using nltk and then create a "speeling-recommender-function" based on three different approaches to calculate the distance between two words, i. e. Jaccard distance on the trigrams of the two words, Jaccard distance on the 4-grams of the two words and Damerauâ€“Levenshtein distance and see how the different approaches can results in slightly different recommendations.
